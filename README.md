My projects

Hi, it's me, Elena Oblomova.
I'm a mom and currently a housewife who wants to make the world a little better. And as a programmer I'm going to create some web services to help other moms and housewives organise their daily duties.

My first project will be a menu planning service. It's code name is MenuKit. 

Let's get it started!
